## Copy Text

Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve. _Pain_, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart. Silently, in a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of **wax** and **rosewood**, her breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of wetted ashes. Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him. The ring of bay and skyline held a dull **green** mass of **liquid**. A bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud _groaning_ vomiting.

Some `code` here:

```js
/* Fill an array with 0's and 1's, and call g(array, width, height) to iterate */
g = function (f, c, g, d, e, b, h) {
    g = [];
    e = [c + 1, c, c - 1, 1];
    for (b = c * c; b--; g[b] = 3 == d || (f[b] && 2 == d), d = 0)
        for (h in e) d += f[b + e[h]] + f[b - e[h]];
    return g;
};
```

Embedded content? Why not!
